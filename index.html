In 2021, his style became more aggressive. Yeat's music is characterized as Rage, a subgenre inspired by the album Whole Lotta Red by American rapper Playboi Carti. Various publications compare Smith's vocal style to Playboi Carti, Future and Young Tag. Yeat stated that the last two are among his biggest sources of inspiration, and also added T-Pain to them.
Yeat's songs use their own unique jargon. The lyrics often use the words "twizzy" and "luh geeky", as well as references to the manufacturer of children's toys Tonka[6]. Some aspects of Yeat's music have become Internet memes, such as the frequent use of bell sounds in the instrumental part of his songs.</span><div class="v4_4"></div></div></body></html>
